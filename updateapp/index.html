<h1>The Steam Content Limiter</h1>

<p>This Google App Engine application provides a few small services for the
benefit of the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/steam-limiter">Steam
Content Server Limiter</a> application, a small helper for customers of
ISPs which have strict bandwidth caps. The helper will force Steam to only
download from ISP-provided servers to prevent Steam content being
charged against the bandwidth cap.</p>

<p>This kind of arrangement is common in Australia and New Zealand where
the operating costs of the trans-oceanic fiber cables are borne by ISPs
who then use data caps to manage the load their customers offer. Since
Steam itself has no support for limiting which servers it downloads from,
this third-party helper does the job.</p>

<p>The services here for the Steam applet to use are:
<ul>
<li><a href="/latest">/latest</a> to show the most recent app version</li>
<li><a href="/download">/download</a> to access the download page for the
latest version</li>
<li><a href="/ispname">/ispname</a> for a best guess at which supported
ISP you are hosted on</li>
<li><a href="/filterrule">/filterrule</a> which returns a filter rule for your ISP
as reported in <a href="/ispname">/ispname</a></li>
<li><a href="/feedback">/feedback</a> which provides a simple, anonymous
feedback mechanism to the project author.</li>
<li><a href="/uploadrule">/uploadrule</a> which provides a simple, anonymous
method of contributing custom rule suggestions for the filter tools</li>
</ul>

<p>These services are primarily intended to allow the installer for the
Steam Limiter to automatically determine which of the supported ISPs you
are a customer of so that the correct filter is used by default, and to
help the Limiter to automatically check for new versions and assist in
downloading the installer for the latest version</p>

<p>No personally identifiable information is retained by this service,
although for the purposes of debugging the /ispname and /filterip services
the external IP address of the visiting host is written to the App Engine
administrative log (just as any webserver does).</p>

<p>This service uses a subset of the <a href="http://www.maxmind.com/app/asnum">GeoLite data</a>
created by MaxMind, available from <a href="http://www.maxmind.com">http://www.maxmind.com/</a>
to determine which supported ISP you are visiting from.</p>
