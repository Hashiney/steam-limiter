<h1>Send Feedback</h1>

<p>The preferred way to give feedback is via
<a href="http://profiles.google.com/nigel.bree/about">e-mail to the author</a>
or filing an issue or suggestion on the
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/steam-limiter/issues/list">project issue list</a>,
because feedback sent that way can turn into a valuable two-way discussion.
Feedback or suggestions provided via the issue list can also be seen by others
who can offer their support for the suggestion and join in with their ideas of
the merits of design approaches to achieving the desired outcome (and for bug
reports they can add their own insight or background to the search for a fix).</p>

<p>However, for people who do not want to use a Google account or who
wish to main strictly anonymous, this form provides an alternative way
of providing feedback to the project author; any message posted here
will be saved and the project author notified, but no-one else will
be able to see what is sent.</p>

<p>All kinds of feedback, whether positive or negative, suggestions or
complaints, is welcomed and encouraged and will be taken seriously. It
may help if you want to look at some of the
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/steam-limiter/issues">existing issues</a>
to frame what you would like to say, but by all means don't feel constrained
by that.</p>

<p>Although the project author is notified whenever feedback is sent,
please bear in mind that between timezones and other work, not every
item will be looked at immediately; however, be assured that it will
be looked at.</p>

<p>If you want to give feedback specifically about the filter rules, then an
alternative and more specific way of doing that is to use the
<a href="/uploadrule">rule upload page</a> (also available from the Custom
profile page in the Steam Limiter), particularly if you have some specific
suggestion you'd like to make to improve one of the filter rules.</p>
