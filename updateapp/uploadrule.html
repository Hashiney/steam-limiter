<h1>Upload Rules</h1>

<p>The Steam Content Server Limiter allows users to specify custom rules for
limiting Steam downloads, if their ISP is not one of the currently supported
ones, or particularly for Australian users where the currently supplied filter
does not represent the optimal selection of servers to use from the potential
range of unmetered servers.</p>

<p>As of v0.5, the intention is that as rules are configured at install time
via this web service, that potentially provides a way to ensure that the rules
are kept up to date without needing to download and install new code, much as
the <a href="http://www.anguswolfcastle.co.cc/steam/csv">Steam Manager</a> tool
does but in a more automated way, and with the ability to exert finer control
over what the Steam client does - the expectation being that as Valve roll out
more of their new HTTP-based Content Delivery Network, the ability of the
Limiter application to control network APIs should become more useful.</p>
